When you input weight, diameter, cross-sectional area of the wire, number of wires, etc., an experiment was conducted to determine after how many executions the wire broke (in this case, 8 times),
and the number of executions before breaking was recorded. Using the above table, AI is employed to calculate the expected lifespan (number of executions) based on the input conditions.
The goal is for the wire to operate without breaking for more than 60,000 executions. The second task is to implement the following formulas on a GUI screen. Since there are two types of formulas,
there will be two types of screens. For the given input values, C is calculated, where C represents the expected lifespan (number of executions). Any programming language may be used.
